Welcome to the official repository of Uranium. Now, what is Uranium? Uranium is the 92nd element
on the period table with an atomic mass of 238.02891u. Haha, just kidding, Uranium is actually an
extensive text editor similar to `Atom.io` or `VSCode` written entirely in javascript, html, and css.

Uranium was written using [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron)
