Welcome to the official repository of Uranium. Now, what is Uranium? Uranium is the 92nd element
on the period table with an atomic mass of 238.02891u. Haha, just kidding, Uranium is actually an
extensive text editor similar to `Atom.io` or `VSCode` written entirely in javascript, html, and css.

Uranium was written using [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron), and was based around all of your favorite
editors.

## Why Uranium

This project was originally made for the fun of myself. If you wish to use Uranium, I can tell you that it has all of the features
in vscode that I know about. Not much else is there, though, so have fun with this.

better or to add features and you can send them over to me on Discord.
